I first attempted this kata at an all-day XP Manchester event.
Then I returned to it just out of interest, and for fun.

One interesting thing that came out of it was that the self-shunt method worked fine until the last minute, 
at which point the only way it could remain valid was if I contorted the code for the benefit of the test, 
which I could not justify.
